# First Semester Overview

Welcome to the university! This guide will help you navigate your first semester, understand the curriculum, and make the most of your studies.

## Core Subjects

Your first semester includes two foundational courses:

1. **Linear Algebra** — Vector spaces, matrices, and linear transformations (5 ECTS)
2. **Programming Fundamentals** — Python, algorithms, and data structures (5 ECTS)

## Tips for Success

- Attend all lectures and take notes
- Start problem sets early — don't wait until the deadline
- Visit office hours when you're stuck
- Form study groups with classmates
- Use Wikipefia to supplement your learning

## Schedule

The semester runs from September to January, with exams in February. Plan your study time accordingly — the workload increases significantly in November and December.
