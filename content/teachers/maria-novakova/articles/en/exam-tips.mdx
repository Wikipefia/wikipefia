# How to Ace Programming Exams

Our programming exams consist of three parts: multiple choice (20%), code reading (30%), and code writing (50%).

## Exam Format

The code writing section is where most points are won or lost. You will be asked to implement algorithms, fix buggy code, or design data structures.

> We test understanding, not memorization. Pseudocode is acceptable. We care about correct logic, proper edge case handling, and clean structure.

## Coding Strategy

When facing a coding problem, resist the urge to start writing immediately. Spend the first 2-3 minutes understanding the problem.

```python
# Step 1: Understand the problem
# Input: list of integers, target sum
# Output: indices of two numbers that add to target

# Step 2: Plan
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

## Edge Cases to Check

Always test your solution mentally with:
- Empty input
- Single element
- All same values
- Already sorted input
- Reverse sorted input

## Practice Resources

1. Past exam papers (available on the course page)
2. LeetCode Easy and Medium problems
3. Exercism.io for language-specific drills
4. Visualize algorithms at visualgo.net
