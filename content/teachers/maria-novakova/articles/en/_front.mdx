# Maria Novakova

Associate Professor of Computer Science, specializing in algorithms and computational complexity. I've been teaching programming for over a decade and believe in a practical-first approach.

## My Approach

I believe you learn programming by programming, not by reading about programming. Every concept in my courses is immediately followed by hands-on exercises.

## Research

My research focuses on algorithm design for NP-hard problems, approximation algorithms, and computational complexity theory.
