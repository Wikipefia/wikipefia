# My Teaching Philosophy

After 15 years of teaching mathematics at the university level, I still find the moment of understanding in a student's eyes to be the most rewarding part of my career.

## Why I Teach

Mathematics is often feared, but it doesn't have to be. My goal is to make abstract concepts tangible and intuitive. When a student says "I finally get it," that's the moment that keeps me going.

## The Visual Approach

I believe in teaching through geometric intuition first, formalism second. A 3D visualization of eigenvalues teaches more than ten pages of proofs. Once the intuition is there, the formalism becomes a language to describe what you already understand.

> **For My Students**: If you can't draw a picture of a concept, you probably don't understand it yet. Every linear algebra concept has a geometric meaning — find it.

## On Making Mistakes

Mistakes are not failures — they're data. Every wrong answer tells you something about your understanding. I encourage students to show their work, even (especially) when it's wrong.

## Advice for Students

1. Work through problems by hand before using software
2. Form study groups — teaching others is the best way to learn
3. Come to office hours with specific questions
4. Read the textbook before the lecture, not after
5. Don't memorize formulas — understand where they come from
