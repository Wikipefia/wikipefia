# Ivan Petrov

Professor of Mathematics at the University, with 15 years of teaching experience. My research interests span linear algebra, matrix analysis, and their applications in computational science.

## Teaching Approach

I believe in teaching through geometric intuition first, formalism second. Before proving a theorem, I want students to *see* it, *feel* it, and *predict* it. A 3D visualization of eigenvalues teaches more than ten pages of proofs.

## Office Hours

I hold office hours every Tuesday and Thursday, 14:00–16:00 in Building A, Room 305. No appointment necessary — just drop by with your questions.
