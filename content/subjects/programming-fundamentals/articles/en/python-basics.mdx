# Python Basics

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its clean syntax reads almost like English, making it the ideal first language.

## Why Python?

Python powers everything from web development (Django, Flask) to data science (NumPy, Pandas) to AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch).

## Variables & Types

Python is dynamically typed — you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

```python
name = "Alice"         # str
age = 21               # int
gpa = 3.85             # float
is_enrolled = True     # bool

print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
```

## Control Flow

Python uses indentation to define code blocks:

```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
else:
    grade = "C"

for i in range(5):
    print(f"Step {i}")

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

## Functions

Functions are defined with the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    """Return a greeting string."""
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
print(greet("Bob", "Hey"))
```

## Next Steps

From here, explore data structures, file I/O, error handling, and object-oriented programming.
