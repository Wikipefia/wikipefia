# Matrix Operations

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. An m×n matrix has m rows and n columns. Matrices are the workhorses of linear algebra.

## What is a Matrix?

```python
import numpy as np

# A 2x3 matrix
A = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])
print(f"Shape: {A.shape}")  # (2, 3)
```

## Matrix Addition

Two matrices can be added if and only if they have the same dimensions. Addition is performed element-wise: (A + B)ᵢⱼ = Aᵢⱼ + Bᵢⱼ.

## Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is more involved. To multiply A (m×n) by B (n×p), the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B.

> **Warning**: In general, AB ≠ BA. Matrix multiplication order matters.

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

C = A @ B  # Matrix multiplication
print(C)
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]
```

## Transpose

The transpose of a matrix A, written Aᵀ, is obtained by swapping rows and columns. Key properties: (AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ and (Aᵀ)ᵀ = A.

## Matrix Inverse

A square matrix A has an inverse A⁻¹ if AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I (identity matrix). Not all matrices are invertible — a matrix is singular if its determinant is zero.

> **Tip**: For practical computation, never compute the inverse explicitly — use `np.linalg.solve(A, b)` instead of `np.linalg.inv(A) @ b`.
