# Linear Algebra: Overview

Linear Algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. It is central to almost all areas of mathematics and is essential for physics, engineering, and computer science.

## Why Study Linear Algebra?

Linear algebra provides the mathematical framework for many computational techniques used in modern technology:

- **Machine Learning**: Neural networks are fundamentally matrix operations
- **Computer Graphics**: 3D transformations, projections, and lighting
- **Data Science**: Principal component analysis, regression, clustering
- **Quantum Computing**: State vectors and unitary transformations

## Course Structure

This course covers the fundamentals of linear algebra in a progressive manner. Start with the **Fundamentals** category to build a solid foundation, then move to **Advanced Topics** for deeper theoretical understanding.

Each article includes worked examples, code snippets in Python (using NumPy), and practice problems.
