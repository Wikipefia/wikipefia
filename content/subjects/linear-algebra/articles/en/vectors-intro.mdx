# Introduction to Vectors

A vector is a mathematical object that has both **magnitude** (length) and **direction**. Unlike scalars, which are described by a single number, vectors carry information about where they point and how far they extend.

## What is a Vector?

A vector in ℝⁿ is an ordered n-tuple of real numbers (v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ). Geometrically, it represents a directed line segment from the origin to the point (v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ) in n-dimensional space.

In two dimensions, a vector can be visualized as an arrow on a flat plane. The arrow's length represents the magnitude, and its orientation represents the direction.

## Vector Notation

Vectors are typically denoted with bold letters (**v**) or with an arrow above the letter (v⃗). Components are written in parentheses or brackets:

```python
import numpy as np

# A 2D vector
v = np.array([3, 4])

# A 3D vector
w = np.array([1, -2, 5])

# Magnitude (length)
magnitude = np.linalg.norm(v)  # = 5.0
print(f"|v| = {magnitude}")
```

## Basic Operations

### Addition & Subtraction

Vector addition is performed component-wise. Given vectors **u** = (u₁, u₂) and **v** = (v₁, v₂), their sum is **u** + **v** = (u₁ + v₁, u₂ + v₂).

Properties of vector addition:

- **Commutative**: u + v = v + u
- **Associative**: (u + v) + w = u + (v + w)
- **Identity**: v + 0 = v
- **Inverse**: v + (-v) = 0

### Scalar Multiplication

Multiplying a vector by a scalar c scales every component: c · **v** = (cv₁, cv₂). When c > 1, the vector stretches. When 0 < c < 1, it shrinks. When c < 0, the vector reverses direction.

## The Dot Product

The dot product of two vectors **u** · **v** = u₁v₁ + u₂v₂ + ... + uₙvₙ returns a scalar. It measures how much two vectors point in the same direction.

```python
u = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v = np.array([4, -5, 6])

dot = np.dot(u, v)  # 1*4 + 2*(-5) + 3*6 = 12
print(f"u · v = {dot}")

# Angle between vectors
cos_theta = dot / (np.linalg.norm(u) * np.linalg.norm(v))
theta = np.arccos(cos_theta)
print(f"Angle: {np.degrees(theta):.1f}°")
```

> **Geometric Interpretation**: u · v = |u| · |v| · cos(θ), where θ is the angle between the vectors.

## The Cross Product

The cross product **u** × **v** is defined only in three dimensions and produces a vector perpendicular to both **u** and **v**. Its magnitude equals the area of the parallelogram formed by **u** and **v**.

> **Warning**: The cross product is anti-commutative: u × v = -(v × u). The order of operands matters.

## Applications

Vectors are ubiquitous in applied mathematics and engineering:

1. **Physics**: Force decomposition, projectile motion, electromagnetic fields
2. **Computer Graphics**: 3D rendering, ray tracing, collision detection
3. **Machine Learning**: Feature spaces, gradient descent, embeddings
4. **Robotics**: Kinematics, path planning, sensor fusion
